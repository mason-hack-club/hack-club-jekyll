In addition to solving real-world problems in school meetings, Hack Club strives to spread problem solving and hands on learning experiences to those outside the walls of Mason High School.

Led by Outreach Director Annie Wang, Hack Club hosted a “STEM Explorations” program in Western Row Elementary School in partnership with Mrs. Vome. There were 20 third grade students working with 10 Hack Club volunteers once a week for four-week sessions. Students learned the basics of STEM through a physics station, 3D printing station, Lego Mindstorm station, and Dash n’ Dot dobot station. Members volunteered over 60 hours combined, helping students learn some interesting ideas and sparking interest in STEM.

By building a strong foundation for these students in the areas of teamwork and problem solving, Hack Club hopes to see them flourish in the future.
