In one of Hack Clubâ€™s most recent endeavors, members (Megan Cui, Vikram Deepak, Annie Wang, Jerry Qiu) competed and found success in the RevolutionUC Spring 2017 hackathon. Over the course of 24 hours, they used coding, problem solving, and teamwork to create a functional website called Rebay, which serves as a tool for buying and selling items. Their resourcefulness paid off, as they ended up placing *third out of 200+ people* attending the hackathon. Hack Club greatly appreciates this experience and hopes to gain more exposure to the skills needed to be successful in a coding environment!
